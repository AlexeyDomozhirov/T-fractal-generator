# T-Fractal Generator

A simple **SDL**-based tool for generating visually T-shaped fractals.

## Overview

The T-Fractal Generator is a lightweight application that creates unique fractal patterns using SDL. These fractals, named "T-shaped fractals" for their distinctive structure, are generated by overlaying patterns of rectangles that can be either transparent or semi-transparent. This project is designed to be cross-platform and easy to use, with customizable settings for generating a wide variety of fractal designs.

To get a better understanding of the fractals, explore the examples provided below or try generating your own using the tool!

## What is a T-Fractal?

A T-fractal is a pattern created by overlaying grids of rectangles. Each rectangle in the pattern can be either transparent (allowing underlying layers to show through) or semi-transparent (with a specified color and alpha channel). The name "T-fractal" reflects the unique, often T-like shapes that emerge from this process.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Cabal**: Ensure Cabal is installed on your system. It is typically included with Haskell installations.
- **SDL2**: The SDL2 library is required for rendering. Most systems have the necessary binaries, but if they are missing, installing them is straightforward. Refer to your package manager or the [SDL2 website](https://www.libsdl.org/) for instructions.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/t-fractal-generator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Build the project using Cabal:
   ```bash
   cabal run
   ```
   Note: During the build process, Cabal may require certain binary files (e.g., SDL2 libraries). These are typically pre-installed on most systems. If they are missing, their installation is simple and should not pose a problem.

## Usage

To run the T-Fractal Generator, execute the compiled binary with or without arguments:

### Default Settings
Run the program without arguments to generate a fractal with default settings:
```bash
./TFractalGenerator
```

### Custom Settings
For customized fractals, provide arguments in the following format:
```bash
./TFractalGenerator {pattern_size_x},{pattern_size_y} {base}^{power} #{hex_color_with_alpha} {pattern}
```

#### Argument Breakdown
- **`pattern_size_x,pattern_size_y`**: The dimensions of the pattern grid (e.g., `4,4` for a 4x4 grid).
- **`base^power`**: these two numbers describe the size of the largest square in the pattern, base also sets the number of splits in one iteration, **it is not recommended to use too large values**. in general, the description may not be very informative, it will be better to see for yourself how everything works
- **`hex_color_with_alpha`**: A hex color code with an alpha channel for semi-transparent rectangles (e.g., `#3af03a23`).
- **`pattern`** (optional): A string of `0`s and `1`s defining the pattern. It must contain exactly `pattern_size_x * pattern_size_y` characters, where:
  - `1` represents a semi-transparent rectangle with the specified hex color.
  - `0` represents a transparent rectangle.
#### Pattern Example
For a 4x4 pattern (`pattern_size_x=4`, `pattern_size_y=4`) with the pattern `1001011001101001`, the grid is interpreted as:
```
1001  // 1 = semi-transparent, 0 = transparent
0110
0110
1001
```

### Program settings examples
1. Without specifying a pattern (uses empty pattern):
   ```bash
   ./TFractalGenerator 4,4 2^8 #3af03a23
   ```
2. With a custom pattern:
   ```bash
   ./TFractalGenerator 4,4 2^8 #3af03a23 1001011001101001
   ```
## Interactive Mode

The T-Fractal Generator when launched can be used in ```interactive mode``` that allows you to dynamically modify and visualize fractal patterns in real-time. 

### Features

- **Toggle Rectangle State**: Click on any rectangle in the pattern grid to switch its state between **semi-transparent** (using the specified color with alpha channel) and **transparent**.
- **Keyboard Controls**:
  - **SPACE**: Toggle pattern view mode (displays rectangles on top of the fractal in places of the pattern where **semi-transparent** rectangles are used)
  - **D**: Toggle dynamic mode. When dynamic mode is enabled (default), the fractal automatically regenerates after every change to the pattern. Disabling dynamic mode allows you to make multiple changes before regenerating the fractal.
  - **E**: Export the current fractal settings to the terminal where the executable was launched. The output includes the command-line arguments (e.g., pattern size, scaling factor, color, and pattern) that can be reused to recreate the same fractal.
  - **Q**: Exit the program.
